A statement is text that the database recognizes as a valid command. Statements always end in a semicolon ;.

CREATE TABLE table_name (
   column_1 data_type, 
   column_2 data_type, 
   column_3 data_type
);

CREATE TABLE is a clause. Clauses perform specific tasks in SQL. By convention, clauses are written in capital letters. Clauses can also be referred to as commands.

table_name refers to the name of the table that the command is applied to.

(column_1 data_type, column_2 data_type, column_3 data_type) is a parameter. A parameter is a list of columns, data types, or values that are passed to a clause as an argument. Here, the parameter is a list of column names and the associated data type.


We can use the INSERT statement when you want to add new records. The statement below enters a record for Justin Bieber into the celebs table.


INSERT INTO celebs (id, name, age) 
VALUES (1, 'Justin Bieber', 29);
INSERT INTO is a clause that adds the specified row or rows.
celebs is the table the row is added to.
(id, name, age) is a parameter identifying the columns that data will be inserted into.
VALUES is a clause that indicates the data being inserted.
(1, 'Justin Bieber', 29) is a parameter identifying the values being inserted.
